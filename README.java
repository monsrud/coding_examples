I did a lot of work in Java, about 8 years between two different jobs. And, quite a bit involved automating VMware with VIJava.
Also, using internal APIs and a SOAP interface to our products. Unfortunately, I don't have any exmples of any of this work. 
But, give me an API, let me sit down behind Intelij, and it will all come back.
